# REST (Representational State Transfer)
Despite the intimidating acronym representing this concept, it is not as difficult as it first seems. Representational State Transfer reffers to the way a well designed web service should work, by transferring states. Navigating a website is done by going between pages, and the page currently diplayed is the current state, thus going to another page is transferring to another state. This style of making a web service aims to attain fast performance, reuseability, and maintainability when developing by using components that can be improved on and changed without changing the entire system.

## REST Style
In order for a web service to be considered RESTful, it must follow 6 constraints:

### Clientâ€“server Architecture
This follows the Software Engineering principle of separation of concern, which is the practice of separating functionality of a program into pieces, every piece having one function, or concern. In terms of a web service this means separating the webserver and client interface into separate sections. This creates reuseability for the client side software, as well as extensibility for the server side. 

### Statelessness
Statelessness means that no state information is held on the server side, only sent to the server with requests in order to serve them, or to a database from the server for persistent state information/authentication. This makes the server more indepedant of client code, meaning much less chance for failure if the client fails.

### Cacheability
REST web services must use caches when appropriate. Defining responses from a server as cacheable or not correctly can prevent clients from getting out of date or incorrect data, while also eliminating some interactions with the server side, as the data will already be on the client. This not only improves performance, but also takes away some dependance on a server.

### Layered System
A client should not be able to tell if it is connected to an end server or a middle man, and using an intermediate manager can add security and other features before it talks to the server.

### Client Side Scripts/Code
The ability to send executable code to a client to extend its functionality is also a requirement of REST.

### Uniform Interface
This is the main constraint of REST and separates the web service to allow for a request response to be developed independently from others.

####Resource identification in requests
This means that the resource returned from a request is defined by the request itself, letting the server handle its data separately from what it returns, only concerned with returning the correct information based on the request.

####Resource manipulation through representations
A client gets enough information from a request that it can manipulate the data on its end(update, delete).

####Hyperlink connectivity web
A client should be able to navigate a website using the hyperlinks sent to it from the server, and should have access to all pages intended for a client once it has gotten to a page on the website.
